# TheRuins_QuakeMap
Welcome to my blog about the development of my Quake Map!

Here, I will post updates to my blog documenting the progress of my project!

What's my project about?

My project is a map made for Quake. To be more specific, it is a map fitted for a multiplayer match between 4 players. 

Theming

The setting of this map is a set of interconnected ruins that resemble a dungeon. This map will have broken walls scattered throughout the locations, acting as cover. With the walls in place, the level would lightly resemble a maze, in which it acts more as tools for strategy, rather than sources of frustration. These spaces will also enforce face to face combat.

Other notes:
This concept may or may not change. I had other ideas, like a factory or cave setting. This dungeon-like ruins setting is moreso a default option, rather than a final idea.
